## Description

This is an app where you can search your favorite meals for recipes and find the nutritional information of its ingredients. The reason behind this app is to help facilitate in creating ideas for meals. This can help someone's diets and lifestyles with having recipe ideas and the knowledge of the food contents. The individual can create new lifestyles for themselves, or simply find new ideas to have fun discovering new meals. This project helped practice how to work the backend with the front end. We needed to make to correct API calls and route accordingly. It was good practice for a fullstack application from scratch.
